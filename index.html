<p>This page is a sample page for a “Hello World” Azure Static Website Template. 
  The page contains an HTML validation warning. 
  Can you find and fix that warning? What about the curly quotes? Do they current work in all browsers? Can you fix the curly quotes also? And what about proper indenting?</p>
